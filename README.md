# PCSystemBuilder
•	Allow the user to select items from different component categories including: 
	CPU, GPU, Motherboard, RAM, Power Supply Unit, Case, Hard Drive (SSD/M.2/Mechanical)
•	Each item should have the following detailed included:
	Name; manufacturer, description (including relevant specifications and price.
•	The app should allow the user to select items and cost up the price of the build but only when each category has an item selected. The PC must include a CPU, GPU, motherboard, RAM, power supply unit, case and hard drive.
•	The app should allow the user to make changes to the items selected before the build is finalized. 

In addition, the following functionality has been identified as desirable and should be implemented where possible:
•	Allow the user to select optional items which can be added to the build including:
	Optical drive, second hard drive, computer monitor, sound card, mouse and keyboard. 
•	App checks the combination of components to ensure they are compatible with one another. This only needs to be done regarding the processor, motherboard and GPU. For example, intel processors will not work with AMD motherboards and likewise an AMD motherboard will not support an NVidia GPUs. It is down to you to research the individual components to ensure compatibility.

The program is to be implemented to work in a Python console application and should make use of the native Python libraries.
